N/A Page
------

- slight bug on safari (the blurred overlay doesn't go all the way down (aka where the searchbar/backbutton/little 3 dots are), neither does the background (it also doesn't go all the way to the top, aka where the time/battery things are))
- can scroll while .nav-links is open on mobile (make it so that when I scroll the .nav-links closes)

Home Page
------

- ???

Links Page
------

- Add a search bar (filters links live with JS)

Settings Page
------

- Make backgrounds better (not properly centered on mobile & bad quality)
- Add more backgrounds (maybe even a color picker or a black animated background with stars/space)
- Add themes or color schemes (dark, red, blue, etc.) saved in localStorage
- Could improve the favicon and OpenGraph preview (so links shared on Discord look great)
